# PairsGame-OOP-JavaProject

This project uses the java ant compiler from Apache Netbeans, so I recommend using the Apache Netbeans IDE.

## Instructions

- Java IDE used: [Apache Netbeans](https://netbeans.apache.org/download/archive/index.html)
- Version of Java SDK used: [Java SE Development Kit 17](https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/javase/jdk17-archive-downloads.html)

Installing the Java SDK (JDK) is required in case you haven't already installed it.

In order to use this repository, you may execute on any console or terminal into your desired directory.
```
git clone https://github.com/SortOmega/PairsGame-OOP-JavaProject.git
```
Or simply download the repository in *.zip format.

Then you have to Open Project with your Netbeans IDE, and select the directory where you downloaded the repository.
